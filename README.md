# lein-midje-doc

`lein-midje-doc` fixes the problem of incorrectly documented examples by bridging the gap between writing tests and writing documentation.

Visit the [main site](http://z.caudate.me/lein-midje-doc/) for more information.

### Features:
 1. To generate `.html` documentation from a `.clj` test file.
 2. To express documentation elements as clojure datastructures.
 3. To render clojure code and midje facts as code examples.
 4. To allow tagging of elements for numbering and linking.

### Benefits:
 1. All documentation errors can be eliminated.
 2. Removes the need to cut and copy test examples into a readme file.
 3. Entire test suites can potentially be turned into nice looking documentation with relatively little work.

### Turn off Advert Notice
It is hoped that users of `lein-midje-doc` can leave the `Generated By: MidjeDoc` notice in order to support this library. However the notice can turn it off by placing `{:documentation {:advertise false ...}}` in `project.clj`.
