# lein-midje-doc

`lein-midje-doc` fixes the problem of incorrectly documented examples by bridging the gap between writing tests and writing documentation.

### Notice:
It has come to my attention that users of this plugin (currently 0.0.15) will need to install [pygments](http://pygments.org/) as the library won't work otherwise. This will be definitely be fixed in future versions but I'm a little bit busy right now so please excuse the mess =)


Visit the [main site](http://docs.caudate.me/lein-midje-doc/) for more information.

Here is a video of the demonstration of a workflow using midje, midje-doc and live-reload. For those that wish to cut to the chase, skip to ~around 7:20

### Features:
 1. To generate `.html` documentation from a `.clj` test file.
 2. To express documentation elements as clojure datastructures.
 3. To render clojure code and midje facts as code examples.
 4. To allow tagging of elements for numbering and linking.

### Benefits:
 1. All documentation errors can be eliminated.
 2. Removes the need to cut and copy test examples into a readme file.
 3. Entire test suites can potentially be turned into nice looking documentation with relatively little work.

### Turn off Advert Notice
It is hoped that users of `lein-midje-doc` can leave the `Generated By: MidjeDoc` notice in order to support this library. It can be turned off by placing `{:documentation {:advertise false ...}}` in `project.clj`.



### Wishlist for the Future:
In the current state, this library is really just a hack job generating some pretty output. It is hoped that when I find some time, the library can be designed to accomodate more features:

- Latex Features
  - Table of Figures
  - Table of Examples
  - Citations
  - Customisation Numbering
  - Appendices
  - Equations  
- Themes
- Elements
  - `:reference` element for tabulization of ns-publics in a namespace 
- Attributes
  - `:ignore`
- Linking to Multiple Documents (Generate an entire Site)
- Additional Test Suites
  - core.test
  - purnam.test
- pdf output with page numbering
- markdown output
- Codebase
  - Refactor with multimethods
  - Clean up hacked-in code
